# Features of feather ssg

This is a return to a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript dev environment built with **Production** in mind.

- Hot reloading (with QR code for **parallel** physical mobile development)
- HTML + **Nunjucks Templating** with Layouts
- **Markdown** support
- SCSS => CSS
- HTML, CSS and JS minified for fast page loads
- **Dark Mode** check with JavaScript (adds `.dark-mode` to body)
- Data hydration from supporting **json** or **Front Matter**
